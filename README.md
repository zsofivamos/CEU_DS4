# CEU_DS4

This repo contains all the codes used for my NLP assignment at Central European University. The main goal of the project was to explore whether female characters use a more one dimensional set of words in popular movies compared to their male counterparts. 

### Data

I chose to work with movies from the ["Top Rated English Movies"](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top-english-movies)  on IMDB as of 15th May 2020. The population was selected in order of rankings based on the following criteria:

* Movies **made before 1970** have been **excluded** to avoid detecting patterns from more than 50 years ago
* I only looked at standalone movies, **no sequels or prequels** - this aimed to reduce the chances of getting unnecessary duplications of patterns detected in one movie
* **Superhero and fantasy movies** have also been **excluded** on the grounds that determining gender of important charactrs could be very difficult. I don't know how to classify fairies, space racoons or trees, so I decided it's better to leave those alone and focus on regular human characters.

**The winners were:**
1.	The Shawshank Redemption 
2. Godfather
3. Pulp Fiction
4. Fight Club
5. Forrest Gump
6. Inception
7. The Matrix[+]
8. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
9. Seven
10. Silence of the Lambs

[+]I am aware that The Matrix is borderline fantasy but I chose to keep it due to its deep metaphorical relationship with the real world. And the epic limbo moves.
