## Now there seems to be a much clearer separation in terms of words spoken by genders
## what is striking here is the difference in numbers of words implying what I've already seen in the data. 
## female characters are not really represented in the top rated movie universe. 
## if you ask me, it is because they are so unique that every strong female needs to have 5 supporting male characters to make sure
## they are not too dominant on screen 

## but due to the enormous difference in number of characters it wouldn't make a lot of sense to derive
## conclusion that males have a less grounded set of topics to talk about - even if it appears they
## have a lot more screen time. 

## let's do a quick analysis
## I'll remove lines spoken by unidentified genders
## plus I'll remove numbers too


## let's also check the TF - IDF version of these plots

  count(gender, word) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(word, "\\d+")) %>%

script_tf_idf %>%    
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%

        plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = "#615e59", size = 8, hjust = 0))

## so I think this is a groundbreaking part of the study - the most important words of the two
## genders in scope are fox for female and ma'am for male. alliteration all the way! 
## while the female column doesn't tell me a lot of hints about the dominant movie, 
## I have a feeling that Forrest Gump had a great influence on the important male words

## this is pretty interesting - I for instance have never heard the word 'yow' before.
## according to dictionary.com this means an intense exclamation of pain. So maybe it's not really a word. definitely not
## a word we want to use 
## it also seems that there are a couple of words tying in terms of importance
## and they are actually referring to physics at some point. way to go ladies!

## despite my best efforts some names managed to sneak their way into the data, but overall
## based on the td-idf score my hipothesis does not seem to be standing very strong anymore
## I can't say that female characters have a generally dumber set of words they use, although
## they do seem to be strongly centered around male characters.
## it is also clear that female representation in movies is seriously lacking, I haven't
## encountered female doctors for example. 

## women seem to have a lot more distinct words qualified for the important kids table
## but looking at them in comparison they still seem to be less important

## while I was doing my empirical research I encountered a study that is focusing on something similar 
## except they have a lot more data. based on their results, my conclusion that women don't speak too much
## in movies is well-supported. they are pretty cool.
## https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/?fbclid=IwAR1VStyy0cZlG_FskdQ7aNliQOINYQVJMg7ItaQigz6An3PQPMajoVRJh4U
## although the study is not very conclusive, I think it is a very interesting thing to look into and 
## I am planning on undertaking the next section of this in terms of looking at princess movies, 
## and the conversations within.
